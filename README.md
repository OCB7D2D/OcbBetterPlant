# OCB Better Plant Rendering Modlet - 7 Days to Die Addon

This mod has been deprecated, as the features have been added to
[OcbCrookedDeco][1] mod, without the need for BepInEx. In case you
only want the fix for corn, you can edit the settings files in
that mod to only apply it for the specific blocks you want.

Old version has been archived to [deprecated branch][2]
